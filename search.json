This is typically:\n\nUndergraduates: 5-10 hours per week\nGraduate student academic year: 10-20 hours per week\nGraduate student Spring/Summer: 20-30 hours per week\n\nYou may work whatever hours you choose, with the exception of any weekly project team meetings or project sponsor calls. That said, I strongly recommend you schedule a regular weekly time to dedicate to the research projects you are working on. Other commitments might easily crowd out the time for your research if you do not prioritize the time. Also, I want to pay you! But I can’t if you don’t put in time.\nI strongly recommend that students who work for me as a research assistant quit any other research assistance, internship, or other external employment."

If you would like to schedule a longer meeting with me, please schedule a research meeting appointment using Calendly."

I’ll do what I can."
