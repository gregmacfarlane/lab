# Onboarding

The process to onboard in my lab is:

1.  I decide to hire you, and you agree to work for me.

2.  I send a message to Jolene Johnson in the department office to begin the
    process to hire you.

3.  I add you to the BYU Transportation Lab Team.

4.  You join the Team and replace your initials avatar with a
    picture[^onboarding-1] to use for your avatar on Teams.

5.  You create a GitHub account (if you don't already have one), and send me
    your username on Teams. Get a picture[^onboarding-2] to use for your avatar
    on GitHub.

6.  I add you to the [BYU-Transpolab](https://github.com/byu-transpolab) github
    organization.

7.  You complete any necessary university hiring forms; Jolene will email you
    with these instructions.

8.  You complete Y-time and desk worker safety training, and any other safety
    trainings that may be necessary.

9.  I send a message to Julie Brinton in the department office to give you
    after-hours access to the building, the transportation lab, and your desk as
    appropriate.

    -   I will tell you when your access expires; please mark this date down and
        ask me to extend it if you are still working for me

10. You begin working!

    drawing by your niece, whatever. Just not a blank image.

    drawing by your niece, whatever. Just not the default block avatar.

## Working hours

When I hire you I will state expectations for a weekly commitment. This is
typically:

-   Undergraduates: 5-10 hours per week

-   Graduate student academic year: 10-20 hours per week

-   Graduate student Spring/Summer: 20-30 hours per week

You may work whatever hours you choose, with the exception of any weekly project
team meetings or project sponsor calls. That said, I strongly recommend you
schedule a regular weekly time to dedicate to the research projects you are
working on. Other commitments might easily crowd out the time for your research
if you do not prioritize the time. Also, I want to pay you! But I can't if you
don't put in time.

I strongly recommend that students who work for me as a research assistant quit
any other research assistance, internship, or other external employment.

## Communication

I use Teams for almost all lab-related communication. Please install the Teams
app on your phone and your computer. I expect you to respond to messages within
a reasonable amount of time, but I never expect you to respond while you are
with your families or other times when you are not working.

If you would like to reach me with a message, use Teams.

If you would like to meet with me in person about a brief issue, please schedule
an [office hour appointment using
Calendly](https://calendly.com/gregmacfarlane/office-hours). If you would like
to schedule a longer meeting with me, please schedule a [research meeting
appointment using Calendly](https://calendly.com/gregmacfarlane/research).

## Wages

Students in my lab have their wages determined by skill and seniority, following
the basic outlines of the [BYU hourly pay
scale](https://hrs.byu.edu/00000185-119a-dab8-a3df-15ffffd20001/2023-student-employee-hourly-pay-scale).
Each semester I will evaluate student work and give raises as appropriate.

If you believe you merit a raise or there are needs in your family that might
necessitate a higher wage, please speak to me. I'll do what I can.
